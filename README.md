# Primes Multiplication Table

## How to run

Just open the index.html file on any browser or enter this [page](https://chiodicg.github.io/prime-tables/ "GitHub Pages").
Type an input number (N) and the app will display a multiplication table of N prime numbers.

## Cool things

- The app uses JavaScript;
- I did not use any library for prime numbers, I created a function to test if the number is prime;
- I learned a lot about traversing an HTML table with JavaScript;
- It was a good exercise to revise all the loop functions;
- The code has comments explaining every function;
- I added a function to clear the previous table before loading a new one, this way it doesn't display one table below the previous one;
- The app is fast and can be opened in any browser;
- It was fun to build and play with the app!

## Future work

- I want to improve the design of the app and how the table is displayed when using larger N numbers;
- I intend to make it responsive to smaller screens;
- I am going to learn about testing and apply it here. I was testing my code using console.log, console.error and debugger. I need to learn how to do unit testing, TDD/BDD. Also, I recently heard about Cypress, Jest and Mocha and I am curious to try them.
